## Configuration

To configure the project, you'll need to create a `secret_values.py` file manually in the `config` folder. This file should contain the following information:

```python
from discord import Object

# server
SERVER_ID = 0 # replace with the id of your main server to update commands
GUILD = Object(id=SERVER_ID)

TOKEN = "" # your discord bot token goes here

# allowed servers for data manipulation:
SERVER_WHITELIST=[]
```
